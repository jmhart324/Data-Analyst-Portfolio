-- Question 1:
-- Find the total number of customers who have placed orders. What is the distribution of the customers across states? 

SELECT 
    state, 
    COUNT(customer_id) AS total_per_state,
    (SELECT COUNT(customer_id) FROM customer_t) AS total_customers
FROM customer_t
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY total_per_state DESC
LIMIT 10;




-- Question 2:
-- Which are the top 5 vehicle makers preferred by the customers? 

SELECT 
    vehicle_maker, COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM
    product_t
        JOIN
    customer_t
GROUP BY vehicle_maker
ORDER BY total_customers DESC
LIMIT 5;



-- Question 3:
-- Which is the most preferred vehicle maker in each state? 

SELECT 
    state, vehicle_maker, COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC)
FROM
    customer_t
        JOIN
    order_t USING (customer_id)
        JOIN
    product_t USING (product_id)
GROUP BY state , vehicle_maker;


-- Question 4:
-- Find the overall average rating given by the customers. What is the average rating in each quarter? 
-- Consider the following mapping for ratings:
-- “Very Bad”: 1, “Bad”: 2, “Okay”: 3, “Good”: 4, “Very Good”: 5

SELECT 
    quarter_number,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE
                WHEN customer_feedback = 'very bad' THEN 1
                WHEN customer_feedback = 'bad' THEN 2

            END),
            2) AS average_rating
FROM
    order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;



-- Question 5:
-- Find the percentage distribution of feedback from the customers. Are customers getting more dissatisfied over time? 

SELECT quarter_number,
SUM(CASE WHEN customer_feedback = 'very bad' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(customer_id)*100 AS 'Very_bad',
SUM(CASE WHEN customer_feedback = 'bad' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(customer_id)*100 AS 'bad',
SUM(CASE WHEN customer_feedback = 'okay' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(customer_id)*100 AS 'okay',
SUM(CASE WHEN customer_feedback = 'good' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(customer_id)*100 AS 'good',
SUM(CASE WHEN customer_feedback = 'very good' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(customer_id)*100 AS 'Very good',
COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
    order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;



-- Question 6:
-- What is the trend of the number of orders by quarter? 

SELECT 
	quarter_number,
	COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;



-- Question 7:
-- Calculate the net revenue generated by the company. What is the quarter-over-quarter % change in net revenue? 

select *,
LAG(net_revenue) over(order by quarter_number),
(net_revenue - lag(net_revenue) over(order by quarter_number))/lag(net_revenue) over(order by quarter_number) * 100
FROM
(select quarter_number, sum(quantity * vehicle_price * (1 - discount / 100)) AS net_revenue
FROM order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number) a;


-- Question 8:
-- What is the trend of net revenue and orders by quarters? 

SELECT
    quarter_number,
    ROUND(SUM(quantity * vehicle_price), 0) AS revenue,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_order
FROM
    order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;



-- Question 9:
-- What is the average discount offered for different types of credit cards? 

SELECT 
    credit_card_type,
    ROUND(AVG(discount), 2) AS average_discount
FROM
    order_t
        JOIN
    customer_t USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY credit_card_type
ORDER BY average_discount DESC
LIMIT 10;



-- Question 10:
-- What is the average time taken to ship the placed orders for each quarter?

SELECT 
    quarter_number,
   ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)), 0) AS average_shipping_time
FROM
    order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;
